# django_forum
Some old django-based forum project that - even though it is simple - gave me a lot of fun


The project has several functionalities:
<ol>
  <li> Users are able to retrieve all posts and comments published to the channel</li>
  <li> Only logged in users are able to create new posts, edit their posts, and delete their posts </li>
  <li> Only the admin can do whatever changes he wants </li>
  <li> Simple authentication towards the local sqllight db and controller changes based on authorization results</li>
</ol>
